          Currently, TAP Group is starting its journey to embrace the Digital
          4.0 era. The agricultural management technology has a huge potential
          to bring us closer to the use of precision agriculture. <br /> <br />
          Managing large and remote plantations is a challenge for the Company.
          Using the remote sensing technology, such as sensor-equipped
          satellites, will improve the data retrieval analytics. As the result,
          the accurate data acquired can support important decision-making. The
          use of technology can introduce many promising benefits, such as
          enabling the company to focus on increasing yields, minimizing losses
          and controlling costs. <br />
          <br />
          Up to present, we have been working with the National Institute of
          Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) and IBM Watson to obtain and process the
          remote sensing data. Precision agriculture requires information
          integrating process. This process requires data whose coverage is vast
          yet general in nature; remote sensing data, with highly precise and
          limited coverage; and ground sensor data. Internet of Things (IOT)
          certainly helps generate the things most useful for all parties.
          <br />
          <br /> We are also developing artificial intelligent (AI) learning
          machine that is specifically designed for the palm oil industry. AI is
          certainly useful in the utilization and dissemination of information
          obtained from big and complex data retrieval.
